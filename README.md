# Lane Line Detection
These are the deliverables for Project 1 for Udacity's Self Driving Car nanodegree.
The code in this project determines lane lines for images and video from a camera mounted on a self driving car.  The lane lines are calculated and then annotated directly on the image/video using colored lines.

## Deliverable Files

## Instructions

Currently, this repository does not contain all required dependencies, support files, and instructions for actually running the notebook.  This to come later.
